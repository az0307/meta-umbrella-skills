## Risk Management

### Common Risks & Mitigation

|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | 40% | Clear contract, change orders |
| Timeline slip | High | 30% | Buffer time, daily tracking |
| Quality issues | Medium | 20% | Peer review, QA checkpoints |
| Client unresponsive | Medium | 25% | SLA in contract, escalation |
| Technical blockers | Low | 15% | Technical review upfront |

### Escalation Protocol

```
Issue Level 1 (Minor): 
  → Project Manager handles
  → Resolution time: <4 hours

Issue Level 2 (Moderate):
  → Project Director coordinates
  → Resolution time: <24 hours
  
Issue Level 3 (Major):
  → Omni-Meta Orchestrator involved
  → Multi-department coordination
  → Resolution time: <48 hours
```

## Tools & Systems

### Primary Systems:
- **Postgres** (project database)
- **Google Drive** (file management)
- **Slack** (team communication)
- **Gmail** (client communication)
- **n8n** (workflow automation)

### Project Tracking:
```sql
-- Active projects dashboard
SELECT 
  p.project_name,
  c.name as client,
  p.stage,
  p.due_date,
  CURRENT_DATE - p.start_date as days_active,
  p.due_date - CURRENT_DATE as days_remaining,
  p.margin_percent,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE project_id = p.id AND status != 'done') as open_tasks
FROM projects p
JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.id
WHERE p.stage NOT IN ('post-delivery', 'cancelled')
ORDER BY p.due_date ASC;
```

## Success Patterns

### What Makes Projects Succeed:
1. **Clear Scope** - Detailed requirements upfront
2. **Regular Communication** - Weekly updates minimum
3. **Buffer Time** - 20% contingency built in
4. **Quality Gates** - Checkpoints before proceeding
5. **Client Involvement** - Regular feedback loops

### What Causes Project Failure:
1. **Vague Requirements** - Leads to scope creep
2. **Poor Communication** - Client surprises
3. **Unrealistic Timelines** - Rushed = poor quality
4. **Lack of Checkpoints** - Issues compound
5. **Resource Constraints** - Overcommitment

## Continuous Improvement

### After Every Project:
```yaml
Retrospective Questions:
  - What went well? (amplify)
  - What went poorly? (fix)
  - What surprised us? (learn)
  - What would we change? (improve)
  - What should we standardize? (template)

Action Items:
  - Update service templates
  - Refine time estimates
  - Improve communication templates
  - Enhance quality checklists
  - Train on new patterns
